											full-stack insurance carrier built to provide the best, most delightful, and
											most transparent insurance experience in the world.</p>
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">We offer

										</p>
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">We’re also a
											public benefit corporation and a certified B-Corp, which means we care about
											the community and environment, and not just business results. Once a year,

									<h3 class="QuestionSection__QuestionTitle-sc-1m3n9gj-6 krcmkC">How is Lemonade’s
										business model different from that of a traditional insurance carrier?</h3>
									<div class="QuestionSection__QuestionAnswer-sc-1m3n9gj-7 dwVoHf">
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">Traditional
											insurance companies generate profits from whatever premium is left after
											paying claims and expenses. This insurance business model could create
											conflict between the insurance company and its customers.</p>
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">Lemonade was
											built differently.</p>
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">Instead of
											profiting from unclaimed premiums, we take a flat fee out of your premium as
											our profit, and donate whatever money may be left, after paying claims and
											expenses, to charities (this is called the Lemonade Giveback).</p>
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">This way, our
											customers enjoy amazing insurance, and society gets a little push for the
											better. It also means that we're happy to pay claims fast and with no
											hassle.</p>
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">Note: The
											Lemonade Giveback program doesn't apply to the life insurance product.</p>

									<div class="QuestionSection__QuestionAnswer-sc-1m3n9gj-7 dwVoHf">
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">Glad you asked!
											Lemonade keeps a fixed percentage from the premiums we collect. This pays
											for developing loads of cool tech, running an insurance company (including
											salaries, rent, and such), and hopefully making some profit! Because it’s a
											fixed fee, our desire for profit does not conflict with our duty to pay
											claims.</p>
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">
											<span class="stronger">Here’s how that works:</span></p>
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">Lemonade is a
											fully licensed and regulated insurance company, which means that we
											underwrite, price, and sell policies, as well as handle and pay claims.</p>
										<p class="QuestionSection__AnswerParagraph-sc-1m3n9gj-1 cIPXNJ">We take a flat
											fee from all premiums paid by our customers, and use the rest of that money
											to run our business, handle claims, and pay for reinsurance. If there’s
											money left, we donate it to causes. So unlike traditional insurance
											companies, we’re not incentivized to deny claims because any remaining funds
											will never end up in our pockets.</p>

Your credit and claims history are two of many factors that may influence your rate, and are dependent on the laws of the state where policies are issued.

But while our prices tend to be cheaper than those of the more established players, that won’t always be the case. Insurers use different models and data sets to establish prices, and on occasion, our prices will be higher than someone else’s. It’s the way statistics work. If it’s any comfort, please remember that any leftover money will be donated to a charity of your choosing… that’s a good reason to go with Lemonade!","faq.car.q8.title":"Great prices?

Certain coverages protect you if someone without insurance hits your car, while others would kick in if your car is stolen, if you need roadside assistance, if there’s liability claims for damages you accidentally cause others, or if you back into your neighbor’s car or injure another passenger or pedestrian.

There will be cases in which we’ll need to fully review the incident to approve the claim, and there will be property damage claims or liability claims that may take longer to settle.

Shortly after you report an emergency, our response team will call you to assess the situation and provide you with emergency services such as water or fire damage cleanup, temporary housing, or a designated specialist as soon as possible.

Even if you don’t have the receipt, keeping note of where and when you purchased more expensive items will help us help you.

Since it’s impossible to predict how much money will be needed to cover these losses, the amounts people are asked to pay may be higher than what’s needed some years. Often, there’s money left at the end of the year.","faq.community.q1.p2":"Insurance companies take this money as profits. That may make them reluctant to pay claims, since it damages their earnings. But we think there’s a better way. Instead of keeping this money, we intend to pay it forward to causes people care about and help bring positive social impact to local communities and global causes. Years with high claims and other expenses may deplete the “Giveback,” but the good news is that our actuaries (the folks who crunch the numbers for these sort of things) say that there “should” be some money left over for most causes every year.","faq.community.q1.p3":"Note, the Giveback is currently not recognized as a tax deductible donation- sorry!","faq.community.q1.title":"What is this Giveback thing?","faq.community.q2.p1":"At the end of June, we calculate and pay the Giveback.

Your stuff is also covered against water damage caused by accidental leaks from fixed water systems, burst or blocked pipes, and appliances connected to water pipes (e.g. your washing machine). You’ll also have the option to include extended theft, accidental damage, and legal protection (by selecting these specific add-on packages when you sign up).","faq.uk.contents.q11.p2":"If you also want your smartphone, laptop, tablet and smartwatch to be covered against accidental damage, you can select our Mobile Devices Accidental Damage Cover.","faq.uk.contents.q11.p3":"We also cover any increased living expenses if your home becomes unlivable due to a covered event. For example, if a kitchen fire forces you out of your flat, or if a burst pipe upstairs means it’s now raining inside your home—we’ll help cover the cost of a hotel.","faq.uk.contents.q11.p4":"Your policy also includes Civil Liability cover. That means that if you're liable for any damage to the home you're renting, or if you—in the course of your daily life—somehow end up causing unintentional bodily injury or property damage to someone else, you'll be covered.","faq.uk.contents.q11.p5":"As always, make sure to review your policy to understand exactly what’s covered.","faq.uk.contents.q11.title":"What kind of unfortunate things am I covered for?","faq.uk.contents.q12.p1":"Unfortunately, your insurance policy doesn’t cover every annoying thing that can happen. The policy doesn’t cover temporary accommodations if your power, water or heat goes out in the dead of winter, or if your apartment gets infested with bed bugs (ugh).

Note that any high-value item worth more than £2,000 needs to be added to the policy as a high-value item to be insured for its full value. With a base policy, your laptop is covered against the list of specific perils (bad events) mentioned in the policy such as burglary, fire, vandalism, and so on.","faq.uk.contents.q14.p2":"However, keep in mind that your policy doesn’t automatically cover your laptop if you drop or break it. For that, you’ll need to add Accidental Damage to Mobile Device Cover.","faq.uk.contents.q14.p3":"And to make sure your laptop and other mobile electronics are covered outside of the home against theft and loss, you’ll want to add Theft \u0026 Loss Cover.","faq.uk.contents.q14.title":"Is my laptop covered?","faq.uk.contents.q15.p1":"If you damage your phone, laptop, tablet, or other mobile device, and it needs repairing, let us know ASAP via the Lemonade app or website. Our partners at BeValued will pick up the item from you (you can easily schedule appointments using their own app) and assess the damage to your item. If it needs to be repaired, they’ll repair it using only original parts. If it’s a replacement situation, your device will be replaced ‘as new’—except for smartphones, which will be replaced with a refurbished Grade A (mint-condition) model. BeValued will deliver the repaired or new item back to you ASAP. You can also opt for a voucher or cash settlement instead.","faq.uk.contents.q15.p2":"Note: BeValued will also collect the excess you have chosen on your policy—this is your out-of-pocket participation in the damage or loss.

For any further information on fees and timelines, please see the policy.","faq.uk.contents.q15.title":"How do repairs work?","faq.uk.contents.q16.p1":"It’s simple!

If your cat or dog bites someone, you'd be covered for legal and medical expenses under your policy.

Why?","faq.uk.contents.q22.p1":"Of course! Like other insurers, we use the Defaqto star rating system, which means we’re independently compared against other providers in the UK. Defaqto takes a detailed look at insurance products and gives them a rating out of 5, allowing customers to make an impartial comparison.","faq.uk.contents.q22.p2":"We’re proud to tell you that Defaqto has granted our Contents insurance cover 5 stars.

We can only make payments to a bank account opened in your name within a territory that is a member of the European Union, part of the European Economic Area, or part of the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA). If your claim is approved, we’ll issue payment in pound sterling, minus the amount of the excess (if it applies), directly into your account.","faq.uk.contents.q24.title":"How will I get paid for a claim?","faq.uk.contents.q25.p1":"We offer 100% replacement value for any destroyed, damaged, or stolen item. This means we will pay you the cost to repair or replace an item (whichever is lower) based on the price of a new item of the same make and model, without any deductions. If the exact item is no longer available, we’ll reimburse you the amount required to buy a replacement of equivalent type and quality. In other words, we don’t pay less just because your damaged item was used.","faq.uk.contents.q25.p2":"How does this work? Let’s say your camera has been stolen. You bought it three years ago for £500, and today, this exact model sells at a reduced price of £350. Since our job is to provide you with an exact replacement, the value you’ll be compensated for is £350.","faq.uk.contents.q25.title":"How do you calculate the value of my contents following a claim?","faq.uk.contents.q26.p1":"Our goal is for the majority of claims to be paid almost instantly. However, there will be cases in which we’ll need to fully review the incident to approve the claim, and there will be content damage claims or liability claims that may take longer to settle. For example, if this is not the first loss you are reporting, or if some of the information we require is missing from your report, our team will need extra time to manually assess the incident, and will most likely get in touch with you for further review.","faq.uk.contents.q26.title":"How fast will a claim be paid?","faq.uk.contents.q27.p1":"There’s no better way for us to understand your incident than by having you describe it in your own words.

If you have a home emergency—like one that’s due to fire or sudden water damage, getting locked outside your home, or structural damage that leaves your home unprotected—reach out to your landlord. They should have emergency assistance under their own insurance policy. Once you’re out of immediate danger, you can make a claim for your stuff via the Lemonade app.","faq.uk.contents.q28.title":"What should I do in case of an emergency ?","faq.uk.contents.q29.p1":"It depends on the context. Keep in mind that your personal items won’t be covered when you’re out and about unless you have our Theft \u0026amp; Loss Cover add-on.

Naturally, we have maximum and minimum limits to all coverages.","faq.uk.contents.q3.p2":"After you buy a policy, you’ll be able to view and edit your cover through the Lemonade app. These changes may affect the premium you pay.","faq.uk.contents.q3.title":"Can I increase or reduce my cover?","faq.uk.contents.q30.p1":"If you discover your belongings have been stolen, call 999 (if you’re in danger) or 101 (if it’s not an emergency). Give the police as much information as you can. Don’t forget to ask for a crime reference number as you’ll need this later when you file your Lemonade claim.","faq.uk.contents.q30.p2":"Remember, if your personal items were stolen from your home due to a break-in (burglary), you’re covered.

Just ask your current insurer how much notice you need to give for cancellation, and set your start date for your Lemonade policy on your cancellation date.

According to this law, insurers who receive a valid order of protection against a policyholder are prohibited for the duration of the order from disclosing to the policyholder the address, telephone number of the insured, or of any person or entity providing covered services to the insured, to the policyholder or another person covered by a group insurance policy. If the insured is a child, this right may be asserted by the child's parent or legal guardian. Furthermore, the insurers may not refuse to issue or renew, deny or cancel any insurance policy, demand or require a greater premium or payment from any person or designate domestic violence as a prior condition, for which coverage will be denied/reduced solely because a person is or has been a victim of domestic violence. The insurer will accommodate reasonable requests by a person covered by an insurance policy to receive communications of claim related information by alternative means or at alternative locations if the person clearly states that disclosure of the information could endanger him or her. If the covered person is a child, then the child's parent or legal guardian may make the request. The insurer, without consent of the person making the request will be prohibited from disclosing to the policyholder or other person the address, telephone number, any other personally identifying information, information regarding a child residing with the covered person, the nature of the health care services provided, the name or address of the provider of the covered services to the covered person. The request must include an alternative address, telephone number and/or other reasonable methods of contact. The request should be made by emailing a copy of the order of protection to the insurer at \u003ca href=\"mailto:help@lemonade.com\"\u003ehelp@lemonade.com\u003c/a\u003e. In order to revoke a request that has been received and implemented, the requesting person must submit to the insurer a written sworn statement revoking the prior request.
